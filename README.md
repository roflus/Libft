# Libft
Libft
Your very first own library Summary: This project aims to code a C library regrouping usual functions that you’ll be allowed to use in all your other projects.

C programming can be very tedious when one doesn’t have access to those highly useful standard functions. This project allows you to re-write those functions, understand them, and learn to use them. This library will help you with all your future C projects.
Take the time to expand your libft throughout the year. But always, make sure to check which functions are allowed !
